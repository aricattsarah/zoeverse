        This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no fuss. It has been adapted from a number 
        of different recipes that I have read over the years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. 
        It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats, and pitta breads.

      <h2>Flavor Variations</h2>
      <p>
        For a different flavour, try blending in lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, 
        harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.

      <h2>Storage</h2>
      <p>
        Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about 
        a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, discard it immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hummus is suitable for freezing; thaw it and use within a couple of months.
